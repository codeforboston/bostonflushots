This application was developed for the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)
to help Chicago residents locate and find public transportation to CDPH's free
flu shot clinic events.

BACKGROUND
I went to a weekly meeting of civic coders where several city agencies 
presented. They asked for our help in building interesting applications around
their available data. I was interested in the free flu shot clinic locations
since flu season was coming up fast, and I had attended a free flu shot event
in the past.

I built a prototype application and advertised it via Twitter. CDPH, the
mayor's office, and a few other civic coders, mainly Juan-Pablo Velez, noticed 
the tweet. Before I knew it, Juan-Pablo brokered a meeting between CDPH, the
Mayor's office, and ourselves. The meeting was positive and I began in ernest
to polish up the application.

BITS AND BYTES
These events were published by the CDPH via their web site (subsequently
published on the Chicago Data Portal). Other events were given directly by
CDPH. These events data are published to a Google Fusion Table, where the code
uses the Google Maps API to retrive those events.

MADD PROPZ
This web application could not have been as well executed without the sage 
feedback and assistance of Juan-Pablo Velez and Derek Eder. Thanks also to Smart
Chicago Collaborative for hosting this web application.

ERRATA
'flu_logo_720.png' image file is for the City of Chicago's own use and does not
fall under the license found on LICENSE.TXT. You must replace it in your own
implementation. It is left here to help you use this code.

This code should be fairly easy to take and use by other government agencies
offering flu shot clinic events. If you would like any advice on implementing 
this code, drop me a line.
